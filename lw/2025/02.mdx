**key takeaways**

Some learnings from this week:

- We define launch weeks as a week of announcing new features. It doesn’t _have to_ last 5 days, though. Take Pullpo. Their launch week lasted 3 days.
- Launch weeks are high peaks. Keep the momentum going by announcing your latest features on places like Hacker News and Product Hunt. Take Prisma and Pullpo for example. Both launched on Product Hunt during their launch weeks.
