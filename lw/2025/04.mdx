**key takeaways**

There's so much to say. I'll go into more detail in the upcoming weeks — _stay tuned._

In the meantime, in case you missed it, read this in-depth post by [Ant Wilson](https://x.com/antwilson), Supabase's CTO, on how they launch at Supabase.

Below are some quotes that struck me:

> **_We rarely hold back features until launch week. Quite the opposite is true. We encourage everyone to ship features as early as possible._**
>
> **_We've found that you can launch a new feature many times over and always manage to reach people who either forgot, ignored, or just plain missed it the first few times._**
>
> **_Don't ship to prod on the launch day. It's ideal to get all the major integrations done a week early._**
>
> — Ant Wilson, CTO, Supabase
