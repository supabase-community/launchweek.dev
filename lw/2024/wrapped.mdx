As we're wrapping up this year, below are some numbers from 2024.

## the year of launch weeks

Last year, we tracked 47 launch weeks run by 38 different companies.

In 2024, we tracked 123 launch weeks run by 92 different companies. In comparison, that's 76 more launch weeks (+161.7%) and 54 more companies (+142.1%).

Running a launch week has a “cost” for one company — if many experimented with it, few companies managed to do it consistently.

Among the 92 different companies, only 7 companies (7.6%) have run 3 launch weeks or more this year: Highlight, Daytona, Memfault, Mux, Outerbase, Supabase, Wasp.

## products of the week

When your team runs a launch week, you are Product Of The Week by default.

If you exclude the [Mega Launch Week](/lw/2024/mega) that featured 22 developer tools (W49), there were exactly 2 launches per week on average.

## a week of announcements

We define a launch week as a week of announcing new features.

This year, the shortest launch week lasted 3 days.

The longest? 6 days. It was Unkey's Launch Week.
