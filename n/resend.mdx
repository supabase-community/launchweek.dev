Startups are all about momentum.

Getting momentum is **extremely hard** and losing it is **very easy**.

We not only have to ship. **We have to ship and talk about it**. We have to push new content constantly if we want to create a feeling of “_always shipping_”.

**Introducing the Heartbeat Framework.**

We think about our marketing efforts as a heartbeat. It's a rhythm that we follow to **expose internal momentum to the outside world**.

Just like a heartbeat, there are big peaks followed by small peaks. It's important to have a balance between them, but the beat must be always present for people to know we are "_alive_."

In contrast, if there's a flat line, it means we are "_dead_" and don't have momentum anymore.

The framework is divided into:

1. Launch weeks
2. Mini-launches
3. Changelogs
4. Blog
5. Customer stories
6. Social posts

Below is a description of each with a supporting example.

## Launch weeks

<Info>
  Frequency: 2-3x/year
</Info>

Launch Weeks are the big peaks. It's when we launch 5 new features in 5 days.

They create buzz and excitement around the product, but require a lot of planning and coordination across the team. As the biggest "sign of life", launch weeks are often the most impactful way we share our momentum, but we are also careful not to do them too frequently, since they require a heavy "cost" from the team.

    In the last seven days, we shipped six new features. Here's a quick recap of what we launched.

## Mini-launches

<Info>
  Frequency: 4-5x/year
</Info>

Mini-Launches are small wins that are worth sharing in a more detailed way, but don't require the same level of planning and coordination as Launch Weeks.

We create promotional items like blog posts, social media posts, or changelogs for mini-launches.
