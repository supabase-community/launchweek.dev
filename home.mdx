    <Accordion title="What types of companies is it for?">
      Both solo makers, early-stage and late-stage companies!

      Take the [Mega Launch Week](https://lweek.dev/mega) for example — when 22 developer-first companies launched together.

      Companies of different sizes participated, from solo makers (KeyHippo) to 100-person teams (Pinecone).

    <Accordion title="Do you need to ship a new feature every day?">
      Yes. We define a launch week as a week of announcing new features.

      It doesn't _have to_ last 5 days, though — it could last more or less than 5 days.

      In 2024, the shortest launch week lasted 3 days.

      The longest? 6 days. It was Unkey’s Launch Week.

    <Accordion title="Is it an alternative to Product Hunt?">
      No. Product Hunt definitely _is_ a great place to launch dev-first products — a place where many launched successfully: Supabase, Resend, and Warp, to name a few.

      This project is different thought for three main reasons:

      1. It focuses on the dev tools space
      2. Filtered out by default
      3. Spam-free by design
