      Both solo makers, early-stage and late-stage companies!

      Take the [Mega Launch Week](https://lweek.dev/mega) for example — when 22 developer-first companies launched together.

      Companies of different sizes participated, from solo makers (KeyHippo) to 100-person teams (Pinecone).

    <Accordion title="Do you need to ship a new feature every day?">
      No. To quote Ant Wilson, CTO of Supabase:

> **_One of our learnings from previous launch weeks was to no longer ship to prod on the day of the launch itself (...) It's ideal to get all the major integrations done a week early._**

  The history and methodology of Supabase Launch Week
</Card>

We define a launch week as a week of announcing new features.

      It doesn't _have to_ last 5 days, though — it could last more or less than 5 days.

      In 2024, the shortest launch week lasted 3 days.

      The longest? 6 days. It was Unkey’s Launch Week.

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Is it an alternative to Product Hunt?">
      No. Product Hunt definitely _is_ a great place to launch dev-first products — a place where many launched successfully: Supabase, Resend, and Warp, to name a few.

      This project is different thought for three main reasons:

      1. It focuses on the dev tools space
      2. Filtered out by default
      3. Spam-free by design
